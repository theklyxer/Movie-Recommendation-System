# Overview-of-our-Project

We have created a project on recommendation systems for movies using Machine Learning Algorithms.

We have combined Content Based and Collaborative filtering methods to make a hybrid model using algorithms like BERT, NCF, SVD, TF-IDF which has produced us an awesome accuracy.

We have also created a website by using the above mentioned methods in which you can search for a movie and it shows the top 10 movies similar to the movie you have searched for.
