# Overview-of-our-Project

We have created a project on recommendation systems for movies using Machine Learning Algorithms.

We have combined Content Based and Collaborative filtering methods to make a hybrid model using algorithms like BERT, NCF, SVD, TF-IDF which has produced us an awesome accuracy.

Please go through the Project Report to find more details about our project and Algorithms used https://github.com/theklyxer/Movie-Recommendation-System/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf .

We have also created a website by using the above mentioned methods in which you can search for a movie and it shows the top 10 movies similar to the movie you have searched for.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.


# AI Film-Finder

It is our website that we have made for displaying top 10 similar movies that has obtained by performing advanced machine learning algorithms.
